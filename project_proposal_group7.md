Topic: Adsorption  

##Intro/context – What is the problem? Why is it important?  
Water has the ability to mix well and to carry many substances - both bad and good. In terms of drinking water especially, harmful substances must be removed from water. The options for this are concentrate the compounds in water (reverse osmosis) or transfer the compounds into a gas (air stripping) or solid phase (adsorption) (Source: Lab Manual). In this experiment we will be exploring the extent to which powdered activated carbon and coagulant can remove substances from water.  
##Objectives – What is the hypothesis? What will you do to test the hypothesis?  
Our objective is to determine the ability of PAC vs. coagulant (both suspended in sand) to adsorb materials. We will be comparing the effectiveness of these materials vs. their cost.  
##Experimental plan including – How will you measure it?  
We will be measuring the absorbance of the effluent of the system using a photometer. This will correspond to a certain concentration of the various dyes (we will need to calibrate the photometer for each), and thus we will be able to measure how long it takes the dye to be removed by the various substances (PAC, coagulant, sand).  
##Key design parameters  

* Amount of PAC: varied.  
* Amount of Coagulant: varied.  
* Flow rates: Want flow rates high enough that doesn’t require a long run time and low enough that black carbon/coagulant doesn’t get displaced into the entire system.  
* Volumes: Same tubing as adsorption lab.  
* Concentrations: 0.1 g/L of Red dye #40 will be the influent for half the experiment. Green dye initial concentration when we obtain the material, but will be a similar concentration for consistency.  
* Varied Parameters: Flow rate, mass of activated black carbon and coagulant.  

##Timeline of tasks/experiments

##Possible hurdles/challenges  
* Photometer doesn’t identify green dye #3  
* Flow rates too high - dislodge the PAC or coagulant

##Resources needed to conduct experiments – What tools will you use?  
* Red dye #40  
* Green dye #3  
* Red dye #3 (only if green doesn’t work)  
* Coagulant (PaCl) - obtained from AguaClara  
* PAC  


##Expectations/Anticipated results  
We anticipate that the PAC will remove the substance more slowly than coagulant at removing substances from water. This is based on our previous observations from other labs where we saw that activated carbon in granular form took a very long time to remove red dye #40 if the entire column was just activated carbon.  However, we do not know how coagulant will behave as we don't have experience with this material.
